### Hello! I'm Isadora Vieira 👋

I'm passionate about technology, art, and creativity.

I started working in front-end at the age of 17, but I had to take a break due to lack of resources. Today, with more experience and determination, I'm back in the field, studying and creating with great affection.

🎨 I also love drawing — from the days of paper to my long-awaited graphics tablet.

📹 I used to be a video editor and dreamed of being a YouTuber.

🐰 I use the nickname **Kuromi** because I'm a fan of the Hello Kitty character.

If you want to follow my progress, feel free to explore my projects here on GitHub.

Let's evolve together! 💻✨
